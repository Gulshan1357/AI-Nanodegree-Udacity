# AI Nanodegree

This repository contains all the major projects that I completed during Udacity's AI nanodegree program. These projects are the final submitted versionsn and fulfill all the passing criteria.



## Project 1: Solve Sudoku with AI

**Search, Optimization, and Planning.**

Using constraint propagation and search to build an agent that reasons like a human would to efficiently solve any Sudoku puzzle.



## Project 2: Forward-Planning Agent

**Constraint Satisfaction Problem.**

Builing agents that can reason to achieve their goals using search and symbolic logic—like the NASA Mars rovers.




## Project 3: Adversarial Game Playing Agent

**Constraint Satisfaction Problem.**

Extending classical search to adversarial domains, to build agents that make good decisions without any human intervention—such as the DeepMind AlphaGo agent.



## Project 4: Part of Speech Tagging with Hidden Markov Models

**Constraint Satisfaction Problem.**

Modeling real-world uncertainty through probability to perform pattern recognition.
